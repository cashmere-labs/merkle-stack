Merkle Airdrop Application

This project contains a full-stack Merkle airdrop application. MongoDB is used for managing airdrop operations, while Hardhat is utilized for integration with Ethereum smart contracts and Web3.js. Next.js is employed for the user interface and frontend development, while Golang is chosen for managing the application's business logic.

Technologies Used:

    Database: MongoDB
    Blockchain Integration: Hardhat, Ethereum, Web3.js
    Server Application: Golang
    User Interface: Next.js

Folder Instructions:

    create-merkle: Follow the instructions in this folder to create and manage Merkle trees for airdrop operations.
    go-api: Use the instructions in this folder to set up the Golang API server responsible for managing the application's business logic.
    hardhat: Refer to the instructions in this folder for setting up and deploying Ethereum smart contracts using Hardhat.
    next-js: Follow the instructions in this folder to set up the Next.js frontend for the user interface.

This project provides a robust infrastructure for managing Merkle airdrop operations. MongoDB's flexible data model, seamless integration with Ethereum smart contracts using Hardhat, and Next.js's capabilities in building dynamic user interfaces contribute to the project's enhanced functionality.
